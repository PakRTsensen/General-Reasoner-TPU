# General-Reasoner-Zero

ðŸª¡ We introduce a novel framework incorporating generative model-based rewards within GRPO, demonstrating substantial improvements in generalization, robustness, and scalability relative to traditional binary rule-based rewards across diverse domains. 
âœ… Model-based rewards outperform pattern-based binary verifications in less-structured domains;
âœ… Small 14B models achieve robust cross-domain rewards; It boosts MMLU-Pro performance by 15%.
âœ… Our method does not require any additional SFT.
